### Why the heckign cat would you write this in Rust?

CMD is cursed, Bash was a bit limited, Powershell is a dark art that I've not yet mastered, Deno didn't have a sexy and working UI crate, Node.js wasn't hip enough, C# development works best with the very chonky version of Visual Studio...

So Rust it was!
